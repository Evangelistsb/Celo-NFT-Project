## Project description
An NFT DApp that let's people to do stuffs like 
- Mint their one NFT on the platform
- List their minted NFT for others to bid on it thereby creating a deal
  - It cost 1 CELO to list an NFT on the platform
  - Which is sent to the platform owner when the deal has been closed
- Other users can also come to place a bid on a deal
  - The bid amount must be greater than the highest bid or equal to the min bid (only applicable to the first bid)
  - Every new bid placed sends back the previous bidders funds back to them and locks the current bidders
 - Owner of deal can close a deal
  - Closing a deal sends 1 CELO to the platform owner, the highest bid amount to the lister, and transfer the NFT to the highest bidder
